# Identify_Customer_Segment

In this project we will use Unsupervised methods to analyze real-data provided by Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions.
The two datasets contain demographic information about the people of Germany and the same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. 
The aim is find relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

# Steps of the project

- Load The data
- Preprocessing (Data Wrangling)
- Feature Transformation (feature scaling and  PCA)
- Interpret Principal Components
- Clustering (KMeans and MiniBatchKMeans)
- Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
